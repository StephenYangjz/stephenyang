Here are some things about me that you might find interesting:

- I was born in the beautiful, German-style coastal city of [Qingdao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao).
- I like VR games and photography, espacially aerial photography with drones. [Here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV154411C7Z8/#reply66991918) are some of the videos I took for my high school in Qingdao.
- I am also trying to improve my very much out of practice piano skills...
