Stephen Jiezhi Yang is a Researcher at [Applied Intuition](https://www.appliedintuition.com/), focusing on building cutting-edge autonomous systems. He recently earned his M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where he also cross-registered at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). Before that, he graduated with high distinction from the [EECS Honors Program](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), earning a B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.

Stephen is passionate about building spatial intelligence and vision-conditioned agents capable of learning and reasoning in 3D environments. He is deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn and collaborate with excepetually talented people. He was fortunate to have worked at [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) under Prof. [Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) and Prof. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/), alongside collaborators [Charles Packer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cpacker/), [Lisa Dunlap](https://www.lisabdunlap.com/), and [Alvin Wan](https://alvinwan.com/). He also appreciates the experiences gained through brief collaborations with [Harvard CVG](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), the [Interactive Robotics Group](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/), and [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
