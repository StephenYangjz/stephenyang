Stephen Jiezhi Yang is a researcher at [Applied Intuition](https://www.appliedintuition.com/), focusing on building cutting-edge autonomous systems. He recently earned his M.S. in CSE from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where he also cross-registered at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). Before that, he graduated with high distinction from the [EECS Honors Program](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), earning a B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.

Stephen is passionate about advancing spatial intelligence in visual agents, enabling them to learn and reason effectively in 3D environments. He is deeply grateful for the privilege of learning and collaborating with exceptionally talented individuals at [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) under Prof. [Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) and Prof. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/), alongside [Charles Packer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cpacker/), [Lisa Dunlap](https://www.lisabdunlap.com/), and [Alvin Wan](https://alvinwan.com/). He also appreciates the experiences during his brief collaborations with the [Interactive Robotics Group](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard CVG](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), and [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
